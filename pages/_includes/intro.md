## Introduction
This guide covers capability requirements of FHIR services to implement a set of profiles and support interfaces in an Australian context for the purpose of implementation of provider directory services.

Many of the resource profiles provided here are based on definitions from the Australian Base Profiles Implementation Guide.

This document is a working specification that is expected to be implemented and tested by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers to enable feedback to improve the content of this guide.

## Scope

* Organisation Directory Entry: managing organisations
* Practitioner Directory Entry: individual practitioners
* Practitioner Role Directory Entry: role participants at a location for an organisation
* Healthcare Service Directory Entry: services delivered at a location for an organization
* Secure Messaging Endpoint Directory Entry: connection details for secure messaging

## Usage

This document is a working specification that may be directly implemented by FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> system producers.

Information contained in this document provides a minimal requirement level for use in secure message end point location and addressing. 
To that end it specifies key entities and elements thereof needed for secure message addressing and also needed interface interactions
to achieve basic searchability operations with diretories. This common core set of capability of systems enables an agreed technical
profile for searching provider directories to obtain information required for secure message addressing.

FHIR<sup>&reg;&copy;</sup> connectathon events are key to the verification of the guide as being suitable for 
implementation. This implementation guide will be used as the basis for Australian connectathon events.

## Collaboration
This guide is the product of collaborative work undertaken with participants from:

* Australian Digital Health Agency
* Secure Messaging Technical Working Group
* Australian FHIR Implementers' Community
* HL7 Australia Patient Administration Working Group
* HL7 Australia Members
